<h2> COMPX301-19A &mdash; Assignment Four </h2>

<h3> Heuristic algorithm to stack boxes</h3>

<b> Due:</b> Saturday, June 8th, 2019 &mdash; 11.30pm 
<br>
 
<p>
<b>Description:</b>
Implement either a simulated annealing or genetic algorithm solution
to find the tallest stack possible for a given set of boxes (according
to the specification given below).  This assignment may be done in
pairs or individually.  The solution must be written in Java to run on
a Linux machine like those in the R Block labs.

</p> <p>
<b>Specification:</b>
<ul>
 <li> The dimensions of a box are specified with three
 integers&mdash;defining its height, width and depth (in no particular order)
 <li> A set of boxes is defined within a text file, where each
 line has three space-separated integers giving the dimensions of one
 box. (Several sample data files are supplied.)
 <li> A box can be oriented such that any one side is its
 bottom face. Thus, a box has at most three distinct orientations.
 <li> Boxes are placed one-on-top-of-another to make a stack.
 <li> <b>Touching faces condition:</b> one box may be placed on top of
 another provided its bottom face is strictly smaller than the top
 face of the box upon which it rests.  That is, its bottom face must
 fit entirely within the area of the top-face of the box underneath,
 without over-hang or flush-sides (i.e. shorter in both dimensions).
 <li> <b>Single use condition:</b> Each box can be used <i>at most once</i>
 in the final stack, in any orientation that allows it to satisfy
 the "touching faces condition".
 <li> Your program must find the tallest stack possible for a given
 set of boxes without violating the "touching faces" or "single use"
 conditions (n.b. this may mean that you cannot use all the boxes).
 <li> The output of your program is a list of the boxes forming the
 tallest stack you can find that satisfies the conditions above. Each
 line of output specifies the dimensions of one box in the stack using
 three integers (separated by spaces), where the first integer is the
 width of the box, the second is its length and the third is its
 height, and these are followed by a fourth integer that states the
 total height of the stack at the point where this box is top-most.
 The lines of output should be in order from the bottom-most box to
 the top-most (i.e. last line of output is the top box), thus the
 fourth integer on each line is just the sum of the third integers for
 all lines up to and including the current box (i.e. the height of the
 stack up to this point), and the last number output by your program
 is the total height of the entire stack.
 <li> Your program must run from the command-line (i.e. as a console
 program) and take two arguments: the first is the name of a text file
 presumed to define a set of boxes as outlined above; and the second
 is an integer specifying the maximum number of candidate solutions
 that can be evaluated before your program must stop and produce the
 best solution it has found. Some test files will be available on
 Moodle, but students are encouraged to create their own additional
 test data.
 <li> Each line of input should be checked to ensure all box
 dimensions are positive integers. Any line of input with an error
 should just be ignored.
 <li> Your program class must be called NPStack.java
</ul>

<b> Hand in:</b>  Submission is via moodle. Submit only source code
and a plain-text README file that briefly describes your
approach/algorithm (and anything else you want your marker to know
about).  Make sure to include in all source code files the name and ID
number of those submitting this solution.  Marks are awarded based upon 
program performance, the quality of the source code and its
documentation.
